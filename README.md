Please note that the application does not display the facts anymore because Supabase pauses its services after 7 days. I only found out about this after completion of the project, and to continue displaying would mean I would need to subscribe to the service. Thanks for understanding!

In the meantime, watch these 3 videos that I made to serve as a walkthrough of the web application! GitHub has video sizing limits, so there are 3 consecutive 1 min videos to watch.

<br><br>I built this project as part of the contents and lessons of this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/?couponCode=24T7MT72224).
The web application was deployed on [Netlify](https://todayilearned-duc.netlify.app/). 
During the course, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and NodeJS.<br><br> The application uses Supabase, a simple database as a backend.
